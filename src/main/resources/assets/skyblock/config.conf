# Config for Deluxe SkyBlock
# It is recommended that you check at least these settings:
#
# 1. island distance - the distance between islands. If upgrading set to what you had.
# 2. resetmoney (general section) - set to true so that everyone starts with nothing
# 3. islandLevel (general section) - the height you want your islands to float
# 4. protectionRange - how big a player's island is at the start

island {

   # Space between islands in blocks - NEVER change this mid-game.
   # Values for a new world:
   # 400 - puts players distance enough that they usually cannot see each other
   # 200 - allows some expansion of the protected zone (recommended)
   # 110 - for compatibility with established worlds. Cozy.
   # 50 - minimum - not recommended
   # Value must be an even number
   distance: 200
   
   
   # Default protection range (even number). Min = 0, Recommended = 100
   # Value must be at least 16 blocks less than the island distance unless you set
   # overridelimit: true below.
   # Use this permission to set for different groups: deluxeskyblock.island.range.<number>
   # Larger values will take longer to calculate the island level
   # Admins can change protection sizes for players individually using /dsadmin setrange
   protectionRange: 100
   
   # If you want to have protection range = distance set the following to true.
   # It may result in incomplete deletion of islands. Not recommended, but not fatal.
   overridelimit: false
   
   # If your distance and protectionRange are the same value and you see blocks not
   # being deleted around the edges of an island, set this to be true, but it may
   # cause some lag so do not use it unless you really are sure
   cleanupblocks: false
   
   # Start islands at these coordinates. This is where new islands will start in the
   # world. These must be a factor of your island distance, but the plugin will auto
   # calculate the closest location on the grid. Islands develop around this location
   # both positively and negatively in a square grid.
   # If none of this makes sense, leave it at 0,0.

   # The format for POTIONS is as follows:

   # LEVEL, EXTENDED, SPLASH, LINGER are optional.
   # LEVEL is a number, 1 or 2
